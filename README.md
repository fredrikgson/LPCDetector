# LPCDetector
A script that fetches all student nation events in Uppsala for the day to determine if a LPC (legendary pub crawl) is possible.

#### Nations
In Uppsala, there are 13 student nations that offer events such as pubs, clubs, restaurants and much more.

#### What is an LPC?
A LPC (legendary pub crawl) is when all 13 nations are visited on the same night. However, this is not as easy as it sounds, as all 13 nations are rarely open on the same day. This script fetches data from the official Uppsala student nations website and determines whether or not a LPC is possible that day. That is, if all 13 nations are open. If a LPC is possible, the script notifies subscribers via email.

#### Why?
This is a silly little project that saves at most a couple of minutes of looking through the nations website. I wrote this script mostly to brush up on my web scraping skills in preparation for my Bachelor's thesis.
